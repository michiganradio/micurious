  <p><strong>What makes a good Curious City question?</strong>
  To increase the chances of WBEZ picking your question for a vote, make sure it satisfies these guidelines:
  </p> 
  <p>
  <strong>Local Relevance:</strong> Questions that in some way relate to Chicago or the region. 
  Example of an irrelevant question: Why is Missoula, Montana such a popular spot for fishing?
  Example of a relevant question: Why is Chicago’s Navy Pier such a popular spot for fishing?  
  </p>  
  <p>
  <strong>Unbiased:</strong> Curiosity requires an open mind and impartiality. 
  Example of a biased question:  Why are the CTA’s bus drivers and train operators so bad at their jobs?
  Example of an unbiased question: Why do the CTA’s buses and trains sometimes arrive at the same time even though they can track each other?
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Clearly stated:</strong> Read your question to be sure it makes sense and do your best with spelling and grammar.
  Example of an unclear question: Burbs in Chicago county and sum others no? 
  Example of a clear question: Why are some suburbs part of Chicago's Cook County and others aren't? 
  </p>
