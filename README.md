curiouscity
===========
Curious City is a web application that allows users to post questions about a city (Chicago, in our case). These questions can be selected for a voting round. Users can then vote for the question they want to be investigated by the reporters of Curious City. Questions and past voting rounds can be browsed by users, and questions can be commented on via a Disqus widget on each question page. Users can ask a question and pick a photo to accompany it.

Administrators of Curious City can create and edit voting rounds, categories, questions, other administrators, and answers/updates to questions. There is search functionality to help administrators browse questions. An admin dashboard shows the most recent user and admin actions on the application.
